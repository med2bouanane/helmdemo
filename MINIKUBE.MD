The command `eval $(minikube docker-env)` is used to configure your shell environment so that Docker commands interact with the Docker daemon inside your Minikube cluster instead of your local machine's Docker daemon.

### What Happens:
1. **`minikube docker-env`**:
    - This command outputs environment variables that point Docker to Minikube's Docker daemon. The output looks like:
      ```bash
      export DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY="1"
      export DOCKER_HOST="tcp://192.168.49.2:2376"
      export DOCKER_CERT_PATH="/home/user/.minikube/certs"
      export MINIKUBE_ACTIVE_DOCKERD="minikube"
      ```

2. **`eval`**:
    - The `eval` command interprets the output of `minikube docker-env` as shell commands. It sets the necessary environment variables in your current shell session.

### Why It's Useful:
- By running this command, any `docker build`, `docker run`, or `docker push` commands you execute will use the Docker daemon running inside Minikube. This is essential for deploying locally built images to your Minikube cluster because Minikube does not have access to images on your local machine's Docker by default.

### Undo the Configuration:
To reset your Docker environment back to the local daemon, you can run:
```bash
eval $(minikube docker-env -u)
```
